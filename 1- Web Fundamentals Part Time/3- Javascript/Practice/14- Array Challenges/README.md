# Array Challenges
## Objectives
- Get comfortable with loops: for and while.
- Get comfortable with conditionals: if/else.
Please work on the following challenges and upload your work when done.

1. ## Always Hungry
Write a function that is given an array and each time the value is `"food"` it should console log `"yummy"`. If `"food"` was not present in the array console log `"I'm hungry"` once.

```javascript
function alwaysHungry(arr) {
    // your code here 
}
   
alwaysHungry([3.14, "food", "pie", true, "food"]);
// this should console log "yummy", "yummy"
alwaysHungry([4, 1, 5, 7, 2]);
// this should console log "I'm hungry"
```

2. ## High Pass Filter
Given an array and a value `cutoff`, return a new array containing only the values larger than `cutoff`.

```javascript
function highPass(arr, cutoff) {
    var filteredArr = [];
    // your code here
    return filteredArr;
}
var result = highPass([6, 8, 3, 10, -2, 5, 9], 5);
console.log(result); // we expect back [6, 8, 10, 9]
```

3. ## Better than average
Given an array of numbers return a count of how many of the numbers are larger than the average.

```javascript
function betterThanAverage(arr) {
    var sum = 0;
    // calculate the average
    var count = 0
    // count how many values are greated than the average
    return count;
}
var result = betterThanAverage([6, 8, 3, 10, -2, 5, 9]);
console.log(result); // we expect back 4
```

4. ## Array Reverse
Write a function that will reverse the values an array and return them.

```javascript
function reverse(arr) {
    // your code here
    return arr;
}
   
var result = reverse(["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]);
console.log(result); // we expect back ["e", "d", "c", "b", "a"]
```
5. ## Fibonacci Array
**Fibonacci numbers** have been studied for years and appear often in nature. Write a function that will return an array of Fibonacci numbers up to a given length n. Fibonacci numbers are calculated by adding the last two values in the sequence together. So if the 4th value is 2 and the 5th value is 3 then the next value in the sequence is 5.

```javascript
function fibonacciArray(n) {
    // the [0, 1] are the starting values of the array to calculate the rest from
    var fibArr = [0, 1];
    // your code here
    return fibArr;
}
   
var result = fibonacciArray(10);
console.log(result); // we expect back [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
